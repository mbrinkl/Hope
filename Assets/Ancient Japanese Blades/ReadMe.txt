Thank you for purchasing Nebula3D's "Ancient Japanese Blade Pack"
This pack contains eight blades(with matching scabbards), six hilts, and 4 materials to construct a great variety of japanese weapons.
The set also includes a classic style katana prefab to show how it should all go together. 
We prefer to put together assembly packs rather than whole assets so you can get the most personalization out of our work. 
If you have any questions, email Morris@Nebula3D.freehostingcloud.com. Look for our other weapons packs and constructions sets soon. 

This kit can be used to create a great number of japanese blades for your samurai/ninja/killbill style game. 
When you need a weapon just drag the blade prefab to the heirarchy.
Drop a hilt prefab onto the blade.
Scabbard meshes use the same center scale and rotation point as other components for snapping purposes.
Thats it! custom katana (or Naginata, or Tanto, or Wakizashi).

Glossary:
Saya = Scabbard
Tsuba = Hilt or Handguard
